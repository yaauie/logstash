[[space-delimiters]]
==== Space-deliminated URIs on list-type params

Since whitespace is illegal in URIs, you can use it as a delimiter when
validating list-type URI params. This option enables the expansion of an
arbitrary list of URIs from a single Environment- or Keystore-variable.

Examples of plugins and options that use this functionality:

* <<plugins-inputs-elasticsearch-hosts,Elasticsearch input plugin - `hosts`>>
* <<plugins-outputs-elasticsearch-hosts,Elasticsearch output plugin - `hosts`>>
* <<plugins-filters-elasticsearch-hosts,Elasticsearch filter plugin - `hosts`>>
